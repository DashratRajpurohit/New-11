    <p class="history">🏜️ Rajasthan – Original History

Rajasthan, the "Land of Kings," has one of the richest and oldest histories in India. <br>

🔹 Ancient Period
<br>
Human settlements in Rajasthan date back to the Indus Valley Civilization (Kalibangan in Hanumangarh is a famous site).

Later, it was home to tribes like the Bhils and Meenas.
<br>
🔹 Rajput Era
<br>
From around the 6th century CE, Rajputs rose to power.

Many kingdoms formed, such as Mewar (Udaipur), Marwar (Jodhpur), Amber (Jaipur), Bikaner, and Jaisalmer.

They built massive forts and palaces (e.g., Chittorgarh, Mehrangarh, Jaisalmer Fort).

Rajputs were known for their valor, loyalty, and resistance against invaders.
<br>
🔹 Battles & Resistance
<br>
Maharana Pratap of Mewar resisted Mughal emperor Akbar (Battle of Haldighati, 1576).

Despite many conflicts, Rajputs also formed alliances with the Mughals through diplomacy and marriages.
<br>
🔹 Colonial Era
<br>
By the 19th century, most Rajput kingdoms became princely states under British rule but retained internal autonomy.
<br>
🔹 Modern Rajasthan
<br>
After independence in 1947, all princely states of Rajputana were united.

In 1956, the modern state of Rajasthan was officially formed with Jaipur as its capital.

⚔️ Rajasthan’s history is full of wars, honor, and sacrifice, which is why it’s called the land of heroes.</p>
